Arcgis Dashboard
1. The AGOL file of EPA National walkability Index was added to the dashboard by adding map.
![Add Map](https://github.com/ashwingis/Week12log/assets/146376104/dd5e672f-0297-4bf1-882b-dd88715b9937)
2. Add indicator and start editing the information to display the Walakability Index (average).
![Add Indicator](https://github.com/ashwingis/Week12log/assets/146376104/ba1a7877-59c6-4412-b36f-736d1d8bd978)

3. Go to map settings and set the map actions turned on for the indicator to make the indicator flexible to the region viewed on the map screen.
4. Add field names to give more information and make it reasonable.

5. Add Gauge and set data as done for the indicator.
6. Since walakability index would be more suitable to be shown in gauge, we change the data displayed in the indicator to SLC Score.

7. Add a serial chart and set the data to network density by auto, muti-modal and pedestrian.
8. Change the color code to make the parameter visible distinct.
![Chnage color for series](https://github.com/ashwingis/Week12log/assets/146376104/3cac92c8-d168-46e0-84c3-5f8b38d308d7)
9. Set the text to be wrapped so the text is appealing in the chart.
![Set placement as wrapped](https://github.com/ashwingis/Week12log/assets/146376104/450a9861-7af4-4fc8-93e0-358f04a232f3)
