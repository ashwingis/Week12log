Arcgis Dashboard
1. The AGOL file of EPA National walkability Index was added to the dashboard by adding map.
![Add Map](https://github.com/ashwingis/Week12log/assets/146376104/dd5e672f-0297-4bf1-882b-dd88715b9937)
2. Add indicator and start editing the information to display the Walakability Index (average).
![Add Indicator](https://github.com/ashwingis/Week12log/assets/146376104/ba1a7877-59c6-4412-b36f-736d1d8bd978)
![Indicatior added](https://github.com/ashwingis/Week12log/assets/146376104/5300bfdc-c2ba-4655-8216-7d535bb4ff1e)
3. Go to map settings and set the map actions turned on for the indicator to make the indicator flexible to the region viewed on the map screen.
4. Add field names to give more information and make it reasonable.

5. Add Gauge and set data as done for the indicator.
6. Since walakability index would be more suitable to be shown in gauge, we change the data displayed in the indicator to SLC Score.
![Add Gauge](https://github.com/ashwingis/Week12log/assets/146376104/92b96f23-80d6-4f05-9335-d6290e2fa4c5)
7. Add a serial chart and set the data to network density by auto, muti-modal and pedestrian.
8. Change the color code to make the parameter visible distinct.
![Chnage color for series](https://github.com/ashwingis/Week12log/assets/146376104/3cac92c8-d168-46e0-84c3-5f8b38d308d7)
9. Set the text to be wrapped so the text is appealing in the chart.
![Set placement as wrapped](https://github.com/ashwingis/Week12log/assets/146376104/450a9861-7af4-4fc8-93e0-358f04a232f3)
10. Add labels from the series tab.
![Add labels to the series](https://github.com/ashwingis/Week12log/assets/146376104/53199fdd-97ce-49bc-b1d8-5359ae07551f)
11. Set map action in the map to be turned on to it becomes interactive as you zoom in and out.
12. Add a pie chart showing the number of households owing an automobile.
![Add pie chart ](https://github.com/ashwingis/Week12log/assets/146376104/c4a4048a-e089-4b4f-be50-0e8d94d1c2af)
13. Edit it to suit visually to the dashboard with a title.
14. Add another inidcator for Pedestrian Netowrk Density.
15. Add another gauge showing Road Network Density.
16. Set the map actions in the map for both the indicator and gauge.

17. Now that enough data had been added, we can format the dashboard and make it look better by adding appropriate color, icon and spacing.
![Dashboard_Sample](https://github.com/ashwingis/Week12log/assets/146376104/205a5829-3743-47b1-b2f5-bbba1de989f5)
18. Replicate the same idea and edit the mobile version too.
![Dashboard - Walakbility Index - Mobile view 1](https://github.com/ashwingis/Week12log/assets/146376104/fbece405-2f0e-4232-b3c7-e734e9355f02)
19. Format the walakability index gauge to change color based on the index value changing while map actions. 
![Change gauge color range](https://github.com/ashwingis/Week12log/assets/146376104/663f3bae-a66c-4999-bed2-9ec07573afa0)
20. With the list, we would like to change the text color based on the index color coding and it needs to be done through aracde coding through advance formatting.
21. Tried and failed many times.
![Code not working](https://github.com/ashwingis/Week12log/assets/146376104/babb5645-b7c6-4aeb-aafd-c17ea5348b02)
22. Refered several ESRI youtube videos, ESRI documentation and ESRI developer blogs and finally it worked.
![Code worked](https://github.com/ashwingis/Week12log/assets/146376104/b4f14e69-cff6-4bc8-a355-975ed163b0e6)
23. Added a splash screen to give an introduction about the dashboard.
